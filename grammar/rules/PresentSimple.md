`he/she/it` + verb [-s, -es, -ies] -> reads, watches, does, has  
`always/never/often/usually/sometimes` + verb  

<b>Spelling</b>
1. `-es` after -s/-sh/-ch -> pass - passes, finish - finishes, watch - watches
2. `-ies` after -y -> study - studies, try - tries
3. also -> do - does, go - goes

Tim `works` very hard.  
We `often go` away at weekends.

### Negative

`he/she/it + doesn't` + verb (infinitive)
